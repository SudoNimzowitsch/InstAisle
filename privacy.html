  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Effective date: February 27, 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    InstAisle is a grocery navigation app. We collect only the minimum information needed to make the app work, we do not sell your data, and we do not show you ads.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
  <p>InstAisle is operated by InstAisle ("we," "us," or "our"). If you have questions about this policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@instaisle.online">privacy@instaisle.online</a>.</p>

  <h2>2. What Information We Collect</h2>

  <p><strong>Account information.</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address. This is used solely to identify your account and sync your store data across devices. We do not collect your name unless you choose to provide a display name.</p>

  <p><strong>Location.</strong> When you use the "Find Stores Near Me" feature, the app requests your device's approximate location. Your location is used only to sort nearby grocery stores by distance. It is processed on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or stored.</p>

  <p><strong>Photos.</strong> When you use the aisle scanning feature, photos you take are sent to Google's Gemini AI API for processing. The image is used to identify product categories visible on the shelf and is not stored by us after processing. See Section 4 for how Google handles this data.</p>

  <p><strong>Store and aisle data.</strong> The store names, aisle names, and keywords you create within the app are stored in your account so they sync across your devices. This data is yours and is not used for any purpose other than powering your own app experience.</p>

  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payment information</li>
    <li>Contacts or address book</li>
    <li>Precise GPS coordinates stored server-side</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
    <li>Any data from children — this app is not directed at children under 13</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect only to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate your account and keep your store data synced</li>
    <li>Process aisle scan photos through the Gemini AI API</li>
    <li>Show you nearby grocery stores sorted by distance</li>
    <li>Improve the app's performance and fix bugs (via aggregated, non-identifiable usage patterns)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or sale to third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>InstAisle uses the following third-party infrastructure. Each has its own privacy policy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (authentication and data storage) — <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Google Gemini AI</strong> (aisle photo processing) — <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not share your data with any other third parties.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Your account data is stored in Google Firebase, which uses industry-standard encryption in transit and at rest. We enforce strict Firestore security rules so that only you can read or modify your own store data.</p>
  <p>While we take reasonable precautions, no method of internet transmission is 100% secure. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password for your account.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>Your data is retained for as long as your account is active. You can delete your account and all associated data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@instaisle.online">privacy@instaisle.online</a>. We will process deletion requests within 30 days. We are working on an in-app account deletion feature and will update this policy when it is available.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on where you live, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete the personal data we hold about you, or to object to or restrict certain processing. To exercise any of these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@instaisle.online">privacy@instaisle.online</a>.</p>

  <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>InstAisle is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
  <p>Questions or concerns? Email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@instaisle.online">privacy@instaisle.online</a>.</p>
